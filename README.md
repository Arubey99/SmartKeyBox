# SmartKeyBox
Purpose of this project is to design and implement a circuit that is a smart key box using BASYS 3 board. The box measures whether there is a key in the box or not and whether there is a person in front of the box or not. The cover of the box opens and closes depending on the signals from the proximity sensor and the switch that measures the key inside the box.


The circuit contains a variety of components to do the tasks that are mentioned above
which are:
1- Servo motor (SG90)
2- Proximity sensor (MZ80)
3- Switch
4- LED
5- BASYS 3
6- Box
7- Voltage shifter
8- Voltage supply
9- AND and NOT gate
